# CS250

During the final Sprint, our team focused on refining the core functionality of the application, ensuring that all user stories were addressed and implemented. Some of the key accomplishments included:
  - Finalizing the UI components using Java Swing
  - Resolving resource path issues in Eclipse
  - Implementing user authentication and data validation
  - Conducting thorough testing and debugging to ensure stability

The feedback from stakeholders was positive, highlighting the intuitive interface and responsiveness of the application. Some minor suggestions included improving error messages and adding tooltips for better usability, which were addressed in the final iteration. 

Some of the things that went well: 
- Clear communication and task ownership using Agile boards
- Consistent progress through daily stand-ups and sprint planning
- Effective use of pseudocode and modular design for clarity

Areas for improvement:
- Earlier integration testing to catch UI and resource issues sooner

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Interpreting user needs begins with empathy and clarity - understanding what the user wants to achieve and why. Creating user stories transforms abstract requirements into actionable goals. Each story frames the functionality from the user's perspective, helping developers stay focused on delivering value. For example, instead of "implement login", a user story like "As a traveler, I want to log in securely so I can access my itinerary" provides context and purpose. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I approach development with a structured mindset: breaking down problems, writing pseudocode, and iterating through testing and refinement. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives help maintain momentum and adaptability. I plan to incorporate backlog grooming, user story mapping, and continuous integration into future projects to ensure clarity and responsiveness to change.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being a good team member means contributing code, ideas, and support. It involves active listening, clear communication, and a willingness to collaborate and compromise. A strong team member also takes initiative in debugging, offers constructive feedback, and respects deadlines. Ultimately, it's about building trust and shared ownership of the project's success.
